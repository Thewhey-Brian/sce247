Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: They are like the quadratic function.

Question A2: n means the length of list grows from 0 to n, and there is a while loop in its function. Hence, 
			it is like there are a nest loop and the outcome is a quadratic function.

Question B1: It is a line. Because this method avoid using the loop.

Question B2: 1

Question B3: Yes. If adding too much pointer that taking the operation times more than the loop takes.

Question C1: 3n+1.

Question C2: Adding an operation time o. To add 1 when add a item in the list.

Question C3: The plot is a plate line. Yes, I add one complexity in the function addlast().

Question D1: n/2.

Question D2: Adding an constant variable mid pointing to the middle element. Whenever adding two elements,
			let the mid moves to the next element. Yes, but not much. 

Question D3: With out track it one by one, just point it directly. This method adds one space complexity but 
			simplify the time complexity.

Question D4:
