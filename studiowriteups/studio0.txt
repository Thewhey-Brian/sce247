a line lies in the X axis. 

Question PS2: Because it has double loops
	
Question PS3: It does not change the but change the value.
	
Question PS4: n^2
		
Question PS5: It will draw back to a line lies in the X axis.

Question A5: The group uses decimal representation. Decimal:log10(x)   tally marks:x   1

Question A6: [log2(x)] log2(x)/log10(x)

Question A7: decimal (because the curve of the log10(x) grows much faster than others)
	
Question C1: It's a single line. Y = aX + b
